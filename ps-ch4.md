# Chapter Lab

Q1: Display a list of running processes
```

```
Q2: (Windows Only - NO Get-WinEvent) Display the 100 most recent entries from the Application event log (Don't use Get-WinEvent for this. We've shown you another command that will do this task)

```

```

Q3: Display a list of all commands that are of the cmdlet type. (this is tricky-we've shown you Get-Command, but you'er going to have to read the help to find out how to narrow down the list as we've asked)

```

```

Q4: Display a list of all aliases

```

```
Current on winclient.lab.internal.local as at 201708(date pending)

Q5: (Windows Only, Linux with wine installs okay) Make a new alias, so you can run np to launch Notepad form a PowerShell Prompt.

```

```

Q6: (again Windows Only) Display a list of services that begin with the letter M. Again, read the help for the necessary command-and don't forget the asterisk is a near universal wildcard in PowerShell.

```

```

Q7: (Windows Only, Firewall rules) Display a list of all Windows Firewall rules. You'll need to use Help or Get-Command to discover the necessary cmdlet.

```

```
Current on winclient.lab.internal.local as at 201708(date pending)

Q8: (Windows Only, Firewall rules) Display a list only of inbound Windows Firewall rules. you can use the same cmdlet as in the previous task, but you'll need to read its help to discover the necessary parameter and its allowable values. 

```

```
Current on winclient.lab.internal.local as at 201708(date pending)
