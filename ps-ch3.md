# Notes/Workings from chapter

reference point: 3.1

Noted in the preaching that they say strictly that only Get-Help is to be used by default. Noting that 90% of the troubles are easily resolvable by prompt.

reference point: 3.2

When updating help, it can only be done by the Systems Administrator. other updates are not allowed.

For controlled environments (government networks), Save-Help is used to obtain the latest version and push it to other clients.

Ctrl+C is strictly the stop button. and More has no effect in the ISE version.

reference point: 3.4

Remember the * when using Get-Help

when using the Get-Help with the asterisk, it highlights the name, category and Module of the item that you requested.

reference point: 3.5

when Get-Help is used with a cmdlet (like Get-EventLog), it provides details on the variables that it uses. enforceable parameters are not enclosed in square brackets. Optional versions are enclosed however. for examples, use -full in the cmdlet.  

reference point: 3.6

when arrays are mentioned, they are prefixed with about_*.

reference point: 3.7

the latest version is available online through the -online parameter

## Note: Microsoft has Open-Sourced the help files since April 2016, see github.com/PowerShell for details

# Chapter Lab

Q1) Run Update-Help and ensure that it completes without errors, so that you have a copy of the help on your local computer. You need an internet connection, and the shell needs to run under elevated privileges (which means Administrator must appear in the shell windowâ€™s title bar [or System32 at the end of the path when it starts]).

```
default
.\System32> Update-Help

form file
 .\System32> Update-Help -SourcePath [folderpath]
```
Note: client PC and main was updated 17 August 2017


Q2) Windows-only: can you find any cmdlets capable of converting other cmdlets output into HTML?
